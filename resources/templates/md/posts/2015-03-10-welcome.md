{:title "Hello, Cryogen!", :layout :post, :tags ["ramble"]}

I don't know how you ended up in this little corner of the internet but know
that I call it mine and you can't have it. Yes, I might let it sit idle for
prolonged periods of time and yes, when there is movement it might not be worthy
of anything more than the trashcan - still, I was here first and that's all that
counts.

By the way, doesn't [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) look awesome? Setup was a
breeze, it has so far proven to be very customizable and all in all I'd
recommend it to anyone looking for ways of generating static sites.

So, that's that. Have a nice evening, everyone - maybe we'll meet again after
I've filled some of the free space on this site.
